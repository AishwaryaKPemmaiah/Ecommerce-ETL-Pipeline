🛂 Ecommerce ETL Pipeline

📌 Project Overview

The Ecommerce ETL Pipeline is an end-to-end data processing pipeline designed for ecommerce businesses. It automates the Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) of ecommerce data, such as customers, products, orders, and transactions, using a scalable and reliable architecture.

⚡ Technology Stack

This pipeline is built using industry-standard tools and frameworks:

Apache Airflow – Orchestrates ETL workflows.

PySpark – Handles large-scale data processing.

PostgreSQL – Stores structured data for analytics.

Delta Lake – Provides optimized data storage.

Google Cloud Storage – Stores raw and processed data.

Docker – Ensures a scalable and containerized deployment.

🚀 Features

✔ Automated ETL Workflows with Apache Airflow

✔ Scalable Data Processing with PySpark

✔ Optimized Storage using Delta Lake for fast querying

✔ Seamless Cloud Integration with Google Cloud

✔ Containerized Deployment using Docker

✔ Comprehensive Data Validation and Logging

🔄 ETL Process Explanation

This pipeline follows a structured ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using PySpark:

Step 1: Data Extraction (E in ETL)

The pipeline extracts raw data from JSON files stored in Google Cloud Storage or local directories.

Data sources include customers, products, orders, and transactions.

Step 2: Data Cleaning & Transformation (T in ETL)

Raw data is cleaned to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Data transformation ensures format consistency (e.g., standardizing column names, converting data types).

Orders are enriched by joining them with transactions to include financial details.

Step 3: Data Loading (L in ETL)

The cleaned and transformed data is stored in Delta Lake and PostgreSQL for analysis and reporting.

Step 4: Workflow Orchestration (Apache Airflow DAGs)

The ETL process is automated with Apache Airflow DAGs.

Defines task dependencies (Extract → Transform → Load).

Scheduled to run daily or on-demand.

Logging and monitoring enable debugging and tracking.

Step 5: Scalable Deployment with Docker & Cloud

Docker containerizes the entire pipeline for easy deployment.

Google Cloud Storage ensures scalability and reliability.

Distributed data processing allows real-time analytics.
