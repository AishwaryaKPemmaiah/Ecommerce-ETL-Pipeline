🛒 Ecommerce ETL Pipeline

An end-to-end ETL pipeline for an Ecommerce business, built using Apache Airflow, PySpark, PostgreSQL, and Delta Lake.

📌 Project Overview

This pipeline automates the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of ecommerce data, including customers, products, orders, and transactions.

Technology Stack

Apache Airflow – Orchestrates ETL workflows.

PySpark – Processes large-scale data.

PostgreSQL – Stores structured data.

Delta Lake – Optimized data storage format.

Google Cloud Storage – Stores raw and processed data.

Docker – Containerizes the pipeline for deployment.

🚀 Features

✔ Automated DAGs in Apache Airflow✔ Data Cleaning & Transformations using PySpark✔ Delta Format Storage for efficient querying✔ Scalable architecture with Docker & cloud integration✔ Data validation & logging for debugging

🔄 How It Works?

Step 1: Data Extraction (Extract - "E" in ETL)

The pipeline begins by extracting raw data from different sources.

Data includes customers, products, orders, and transactions in JSON format.

The pipeline reads this data from Google Cloud Storage (or local files) into PySpark for further processing.

This step ensures that all necessary data is collected before transformations.

Step 2: Data Cleaning & Transformation (Transform - "T" in ETL)

Once the raw data is extracted, the next step is to clean and structure it:

Removing duplicates and handling missing values.

Standardizing column names and formats for consistency.

Joining datasets to create a structured format for analysis.

Applying business rules such as calculating total sales per order.

The transformed data is then stored in an optimized Delta Lake format for fast processing.

Step 3: Data Loading (Load - "L" in ETL)

After transformation, the cleaned data is loaded into PostgreSQL for storage and analysis.

The pipeline inserts the structured data into PostgreSQL tables for reporting and querying.

Historical data is stored efficiently in Delta Lake for future analysis.

This ensures fast retrieval and scalability of ecommerce data.

Step 4: Workflow Orchestration (Apache Airflow DAGs)

The entire ETL process is automated and scheduled using Apache Airflow.

Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) define the order of tasks (Extract → Transform → Load).

It ensures the pipeline runs on schedule (e.g., daily) or on-demand.

Logging and monitoring help track failures and debug issues in the ETL process.

Step 5: Scalable Deployment with Docker & Cloud Integration

The pipeline is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy.

Data is stored and processed on Google Cloud, allowing scalability.

This setup allows for distributed data processing and real-time analytics.
